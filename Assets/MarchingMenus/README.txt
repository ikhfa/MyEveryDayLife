Overview
==========================================

This UnityAsset is a companion to the Labs.LeapMotion.com blog post
on rethinking interaction design for gestural interfaces. 
(http://labs.leapmotion.com/rethinking-menu-design-in-the-natural-interface-wild-west/)
It shows a working example of a menu design we dubbed a "Marching Menu" during our
UX prototyping that was particularly successful. It is meant as both an
example of how to develop a 2D menu with LeapMotion and as a jumping
off point for your own design work. 

==========================================
Dependencies
==========================================

This UnityAsset uses the "LeapMotion Boilerplate” Asset (packaged with this asset)
as a set of boilderplate code to access the Leapmotion data and convert it into Unity 
data types. More information can be found in the README.txt in the Boilerplate’s root folder.
